# Hugo Simple Beauty Theme

A minimalist, clean, and highly readable Hugo theme designed for personal blogs, book summaries, and technical writing.

## Features

### 🎨 Design & UI
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Focuses on typography and whitespace for an editorial feel.
- **System-based Dark Mode**: Automatically respects OS preferences with a dedicated manual toggle.
- **Responsive**: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Typography**: Uses the modern **Inter** font for UI and the elegant **Lora** serif for long-form reading.
- **Smooth Interaction**: Built-in smooth scrolling and subtle transitions.

### 🛠 Technical Features
- **Adaptive Syntax Highlighting**: Custom-themed code blocks that adjust colors for light and dark modes.
- **Related Writing**: Built-in engine suggests related posts based on tags and categories.
- **Reading Time**: Automatically calculates and displays the estimated reading time for each post.
- **SEO Optimized**: Pre-configured with Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and Canonical URLs.
- **Back to Top**: A smart floating button that appears as you scroll.

### 🧩 Shortcodes
- **Notice/Callouts**: Beautiful styled boxes for `info` or `warning` messages.

````markdown
{{</* notice type="info" title="Pro Tip" */>}}
Your content here...
{{</* /notice */>}}
````

renders as

{{< notice type="info" title="Pro Tip" >}}
Your content here...
{{< /notice >}}


## Installation

1. From the root of your Hugo site, add the theme as a git submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/prule/hugo-simple-beauty.git themes/hugo-simple-beauty
   ```
2. Update your `hugo.toml` (or `config.toml`) to use the theme:
   ```toml
   theme = "hugo-simple-beauty"
   ```

## Configuration

### Main Menu
Configure your navigation in `hugo.toml`:
```toml
[[menu.main]]
    name = "Home"
    url = "/"
    weight = 1
[[menu.main]]
    name = "Projects"
    url = "/projects"
    weight = 2
```

### Social Links & Avatar
Add your profiles and profile picture under `[params]`:
```toml
[params]
    description = "Software Developer & Reader"
    sidebar_avatar = "/images/profile.jpg"
    
    # Social
    github = "https://github.com/..."
    linkedin = "https://linkedin.com/in/..."
    medium = "https://medium.com/@..."
    substack = "https://your.substack.com"
```

### Syntax Highlighting
Ensure your highlighter is configured to use classes:
```toml
[markup.highlight]
    noClasses = false
```

## Content Structure
- **Sections**: Use `_index.md` in folders (like `booksummaries/`) to create section landing pages.
- **Dates**: If a date is not specified in front matter, it will be hidden automatically (perfect for "Page" content).
- **Tags/Categories**: Use these in your front matter to power the "Related Writing" section.
