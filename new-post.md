# A rest api

The openapi definition

```yaml
post:
  tags:
    - transfers
  operationId: createTransfer
  summary: Transfer funds from one account to another
  description: >
    Atomically debits the source account, credits the destination account,
    and records exactly one balanced journal entry with status PENDING.
    Either all effects commit or none do. Callers re-read the affected
    accounts via GET /api/v1/accounts/{accountNumber} for the new balances.

    Optionally accepts an Idempotency-Key header. When supplied, the server
    persists the response keyed by that value and replays the stored response
    on retries carrying the same key. See the transfer-idempotency capability
    spec for the full contract.
  parameters:
    - in: header
      name: Idempotency-Key
      required: false
      description: >
        Optional client-chosen unique token (1..200 printable ASCII
        characters; UUIDs recommended). When supplied, retries of the same
        key with the same request body return the original response without
        re-executing the transfer. Retries with the same key but a different
        body are rejected with 422 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED. A concurrent
        in-flight retry returns 409 CONCURRENT_IDEMPOTENT_REQUEST.

        Validation or business-rule rejection. Body's `code` identifies
        the cause: BAD_REQUEST_PAYLOAD (malformed/missing fields, non-positive
        amount, same-account transfer, or malformed Idempotency-Key),
        ACCOUNT_INACTIVE (source or destination is not Active), or
        INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS (source would be overdrawn).

        Another request bearing the same Idempotency-Key is already in

        The supplied Idempotency-Key was previously used with a different
        request body. Body's `code` is `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`. Typical
        cause: client bug reusing a key across distinct transfers.

The rest endpoint:

```java
    @Override
    @Transactional
    public ResponseEntity<Void> createTransfer(TransferRequest request, String idempotencyKey) {
        TransferCommand command = mapper.toCommand(request);
        if (idempotencyKey == null) {
            transferMetrics.transfer(command);
            return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();
        }

        IdempotencyKey key = IdempotencyKey.of(idempotencyKey);
        RequestFingerprint fingerprint = fingerprintComputer.fingerprintOf(serialise(request));

        ResponseRecord result = idempotencyStore.executeIdempotent(key, fingerprint, () -> runAndCapture(command));
        return toResponseEntity(result);
    }
```
