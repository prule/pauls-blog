  ```markdown
  {{< notice type="info" title="Pro Tip" >}}
  Your content here...
  {{< /notice >}}
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your `themes` folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prule/hugo-simple-beauty.git themes/hugo-simple-beauty
   ```
2. Update your `hugo.toml` (or `config.toml`) to use the theme:
   ```toml
   theme = "hugo-simple-beauty"
   ```

## Configuration

### Main Menu
Configure your navigation in `hugo.toml`:
```toml
[[menu.main]]
    name = "Home"
    url = "/"
    weight = 1
[[menu.main]]
    name = "Projects"
    url = "/projects"
    weight = 2
```

### Social Links & Avatar
Add your profiles and profile picture under `[params]`:
```toml
[params]
    description = "Software Developer & Reader"
    sidebar_avatar = "/images/profile.jpg"
    
    # Social
    github = "https://github.com/..."
    linkedin = "https://linkedin.com/in/..."
    medium = "https://medium.com/@..."
    substack = "https://your.substack.com"
```

### Syntax Highlighting
Ensure your highlighter is configured to use classes:
```toml
[markup.highlight]
    noClasses = false
```

## Content Structure
- **Sections**: Use `_index.md` in folders (like `booksummaries/`) to create section landing pages.
- **Dates**: If a date is not specified in front matter, it will be hidden automatically (perfect for "Page" content).
- **Tags/Categories**: Use these in your front matter to power the "Related Writing" section.
